## Lab 1

### LEARNING OBJECTIVES
<b>
Basic OpenGL, input & interaction, and animation. After completing the programming
assignment, you should have learned

• the basic structure of an OpenGL program,

• how to use some basic OpenGL functions,

• how to use the GLUT (FreeGLUT) callback to get user input and enable interaction,

• how to use double-buffering to make animation look smoother, and

• how to use the GLUT (FreeGLUT) timer callback to control the speed of animation
